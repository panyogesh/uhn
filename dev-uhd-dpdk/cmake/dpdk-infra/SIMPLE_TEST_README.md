# Simple DPDK Infrastructure Verification

Due to ongoing issues with mbuf data buffer allocation, here's a simplified test approach:

## Problem Summary

The `rte_pktmbuf_pool_create()` is creating pools, but the mbufs allocated from them have invalid data buffers. This suggests a DPDK version compatibility issue or incorrect parameters.

## Simplified Verification Steps

### 1. Verify EAL Initialization

Both processes can initialize DPDK EAL correctly (this works).

### 2. Verify Pool Creation

Primary can create packet mbuf pools (this works).

### 3. Verify Ring Creation

Primary can create DPDK rings (this works).

### 4. Verify Secondary Attachment

Secondary can attach and lookup pools/rings (this works).

## What's NOT Working

**Mbuf Data Access**: Even though pools are created with `rte_pktmbuf_pool_create()`, the mbufs have invalid buf_addr pointers.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Check DPDK Version
```bash
pkg-config --modversion libdpdk
```

If < 20.11, the `rte_pktmbuf_pool_create()` API might be different.

### Option 2: Use Explicit Mbuf Initialization

Instead of relying on `rte_pktmbuf_pool_create()`, use:
```cpp
rte_pktmbuf_pool_create_by_ops(
    name,
    n,
    cache,
    0,  // priv_size
    data_room,
    socket_id,
    "ring_mp_mc");  // ops_name
```

### Option 3: Verify Hugepage Configuration

The invalid buf_addr might be due to hugepage issues:
```bash
# Check current hugepages
cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge

# Increase if needed
sudo sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=1024

# Verify mount
mount | grep huge
```

### Option 4: Test with DPDK Examples

Before using custom code, test with DPDK's own multi-process examples:
```bash
cd /usr/share/dpdk/examples/multi_process/simple_mp
make
# Run in separate terminals
./build/simple_mp -l 0-1 --proc-type=primary
./build/simple_mp -l 2-3 --proc-type=secondary
```

If DPDK examples work, the issue is in our pool creation parameters.

## Current Status

✅ EAL initialization (primary & secondary)
✅ Pool creation (shows success message)
✅ Ring creation  
✅ Secondary process attachment
❌ Mbuf data buffer access (NULL/invalid pointers)

## Conclusion

The infrastructure is 95% working. The only remaining issue is the mbuf buffer allocation, which is likely a DPDK configuration or version compatibility problem that requires:

1. Checking DPDK version compatibility
2. Testing with DPDK's own examples
3. Reviewing system hugepage configuration
4. Possibly adjusting mbuf pool creation parameters based on DPDK version
